What made me decide to leave a good job and join a Web Development immersive? 

Before joining Learn.co's online full stack web development program, I worked in Ad Operations at a large tech company. While there were many positives about my career, I couldn't help but feel that the scope of my job was so limited compared to the endless possibilities that exist in using tech to better the world. After working in Ad Tech for a couple years, I realized that I didn't want to be selling or reporting bugs in products, I wanted to be creating and improving them.

Passion for problem-solving + desire to innovate + respect for hard work + thirst for knowledge + love of tech = Web Development student
