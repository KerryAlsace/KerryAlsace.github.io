For one of the Assessments in Learn.co's Full Stack Web Development course students are required to create an app using Rails. Before beginning the project, there is a list of requirements that students can read through. In a student's frame of mind, I looked at these as requirements to pass my assessment. With a completed project and hindsight, I think it would have been better to look at them with developer's frame of mind (duh, that's the whole point of working towards becoming a developer) and view them as feature requirements for a product for real users.

What's the difference between these views? As a student, I wanted to build a product I'd enjoy making, since the end user would just be me and my instructor. I already had an idea of the app I wanted to make, and right off the bat I'd fulfill most of the requirements just by making my app work how I wanted. Sure, there were a few requirements that I didn't fully understand or have an idea yet of how I'd fulfill them, but I figured once I started building my app, things would come together and I'd have a clearer idea of how to make everything work.

If I were to have viewed this project initially as though I were a developer, I would have spent more time in the pre-coding phase to work out, not only how to just meet each requirement, but how to make them all fit together in a cohesive, user-friendly way. I might have viewed these requirements as features that had been weighed and planned out by a team of product managers and designers, with client feedback from user testing. I wouldn't have ignored some of these important feature requests just because I couldn't picture how they would work with my idea of what the app should look like. I'd have worked with my team (or in my real case, my instructors and fellow students) to make sure I fully understood the requirements beforehand and that my plan for the app would adequately meet them all, BEFORE I started actually building anything.

As it happened, I didn't do this. I built an app I like, then got completely stuck trying to figure out how to shoe-horn in some additional features to meet the requirements. This meant having to remove some of the features I had already spent a lot of time and effort building, all while kicking myself for not doing better planning ahead of time.

Luckily, I was able to learn this lesson in a fairly risk-free setting. I'll be able to take this knowledge with me to my next apps/classes/jobs and remember to always keep the user and user requirements in mind when developing.

- - Start developing with general idea of outcome
- Have to shoe-horn in features and requirements
